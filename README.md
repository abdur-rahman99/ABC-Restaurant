The ABC Restaurant Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline restaurant operations by allowing admins to manage staff, customers to make reservations, and staff to oversee restaurant operations. The system offers separate panels for customers, staff, and administrators to ensure smooth functioning of day-to-day tasks, from handling reservations to managing employee data.

This project was built using the Tomcat server for running the web application, a MySQL database for storing data, and HTML and CSS for designing the user interfaces. The project incorporates a simple and clean design with form validations, data handling, and responsive layouts.


Customer Panel: Customers can create reservations, view their booking statuses (pending, approved, or rejected), submit query and view gallery.

Staff Panel: Staff can log in and manage reservations, view bookings, and respond to customer queries.

Admin Panel: Administrators can add and delete staff members, view all reservations, and manage system users.


Backend:

Apache Tomcat: The server used to host and run the web application.
MySQL: Database used for storing user data, staff information, reservations, and login credentials.
JSP (Java Server Pages): Used for dynamic content generation and to connect with the database.

Frontend:

HTML5: For structuring the web pages.
CSS3: For designing and styling the application interface, applying responsive layouts, and ensuring a consistent user experience.
